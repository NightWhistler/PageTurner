 * Helper class which converts media-button events into PageTurner-specific events.

 * Since a BroadCastReceiver for MediaButton events has to be specified
 * by class-name, the created instance will have no access to the activity.
 *
 * To work around this problem, this class will re-broadcast any media
 * events as pageturner.media.key events, which can then be picked up
 * by an internal class inside an Activity or Fragment.
